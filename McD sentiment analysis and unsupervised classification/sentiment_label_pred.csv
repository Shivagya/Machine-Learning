"TOXIC DUMP! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others ""trapped"" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself ""trapped"" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). Î¾God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It's been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant. You should be ashamed.**************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ Î¾YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls!

"On my way to Curry Honda for my scheduled maintenance appointment, I went to the drive-thru of this McDonald's since it was so conveniently located almost adjacent to the Honda dealership. Î¾It was around 1:45 pm on a Saturday afternoon, and there were probably only two cars in front of me, so I thought I'd be in and out of there quickly. Î¾What I thought would be a ""quick"" drive-thru took over ten minutes. Î¾I'm not sure what the hold up was, but perhaps one (or both) of the cars in front of me got a large order. Î¾All I ordered was a Spicy McChicken Sandwich, small fries, and a cup of ice water.Again, Curry Honda is located super close to the McDonald's, so the food should have still been hot (or at least warm) when I got there. Î¾However, when I sat down to eat my food in the waiting room, I noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm, and the ice in my water was almost completely melted.

Yes, it even showed it on your fancy digital menu. Then they would ask me to pull up and wait 10 minutes for my order to be corrected. My bf and I went inside once to order and they got his order wrong. The woman just stood there and looked at us when we told her and my bf was like, ""...but I guess I can eat this"". Later when we went up and asked for sauce, she gave us the biggest eyeroll upon seeing us and acted like it was physically painful for her to serve us.

"Don't tell anyone but I like McDonald's coffee better than Starbucks. I rather have McDonald's coffee over any other coffee in the world. This McDonald's location would have gotten 5 stars about 3 months ago, but things have changed. A few months ago, the workers were really cool, but now they have all just gotten really f*cking weird!

About 2 minutes later I begin hearing a ton of static and then this bizarre sounding guy starts talking in this strange tone. He sounded like a drunk Orson Wells. When I pulled up to the first window to pay, the window slowly slid open to reveal the face of a morbid looking kid with gigantic dilated eyes and one of those horror movie smiles. Immediately he lets out this high pitched: ""reeehhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"" noise at me. At that particular moment, due to the fear of man-rape, I thought about driving over the planters and escaping. But, he looked so weird that I came to the conclusion that he might have some kind of paranormal super powers and would catch me no matter how fast I drove, so I just sat there and awaited my fate. After about 2-3 seconds he told me how much my coffee cost in a disturbingly soft tone voice, and thankfully he didn't serve me McRape. Î¾When I drove up to the pick-up window, I was greeted by an anorexic looking latino kid who didn't even give me eye contact, and while holding the coffee he sticks his arm out the window and just drops it before I even have the chance to reach out to grab it.

"Years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. Why do I keep going back?Having nothing to do with Mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. I have been going to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I used to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretty much everything I use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). It is the only convenient location, and for a while Mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! Service: I used to be a manager with another fast food chain. I know what service SHOULD be. I also know what it usually is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). We received a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. We have never received a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad example and move on.Dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: Something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. Some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before I received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. Tonight I ordered the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. According to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. I have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. They consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorry they are and suggest I try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. From what I was told they are revamping this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! I keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if I will ever receive my food. I highly do not recommend this location. Hopefully you won't be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me! -Sarah (This was written by Paul's wife because I am usually the one dealing with them.

It was 5:00 AM and although our appetites were ginormous, our options were limited. We happened upon this McDonald's where they were offering double cheeseburgers for $0.99. I ordered three. My companions followed suit. We sat down among the other customers: three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business cards. One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything. The last man was not so far gone but was the dirtiest of them all. Once our burgers were consumed, we headed out. I was glad to leave... only sleep lay before me now.",one star food engineer matter happen edible think id review particular last ever eat year dark night cool spring air friend stumble casino drink free beer poor expensive gamble although appetite ginormous option limit happen upon offer double cheeseburger order three companion follow suit sit among customer three old men sparsely seat desperate stay awake lest throw street amongst crumple pornographic business card one man chew eye close another bob head either fall sleep agree everything last man far go dirty burger consume head glad leave sleep lay,0,0.09359501302242279,0.11983828991651535,0.03936130553483963,0.042590294033288956,0.520525336265564,0.16086538136005402,0.02322438918054104,0

"I usually don't have problems with this location even though I get irritated with their employees' attitudes sometimes. Today, however, my experience annoyed me more than usual because of the dumb people who work there. The one worker that I absolutely dread encountering is the slightly older woman with glasses who is on the heavier side. She has the worst attitude out of all the workers there and it is clear that she hates her job. She is just not friendly at all and can never get an order right. When I drove up to the pick up window, a teenage employee was there and gave me my bag of food. I ordered two combos. I waited about 15 seconds for my drinks, and he was awkwardly standing there, wondering why I didn't drive off yet. Then he asked, ""Are you waiting for something else? That should be it."" I said, ""...We ordered drinks too."" He looks behind him and there are my drinks! ""Oh!"" he exclaims. As I am situating the drinks into my cup holders, I hear him say, ""Here."" When I turn around towards the window, half of his arm is in my car and the straws almost hit my face! WTF?! I was so irritated by his incompetency. Also, one thing that I don't like is how two drive-thru speakers are built, but the employees are always confused by which one to use. For example, I would order at the first speaker. When there is a long line, I get stuck at the second speaker and a worker tries to take my order there when I already ordered at the first one! Sometimes I tell them that I've already ordered, and sometimes I ignore them even when they're constantly asking, ""Hello? Are you ready to order?""Incompetent workers and a confusing drive-thru!

Î¾This doesn't bother me much. Î¾But...they were also very stinky. Î¾Yes, stinky. Î¾I have no problem with stinky in most cases (I occasionally help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn't washed in DAYS if I were to guess. Î¾To each his own, and I know it's almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN. Î¾If I get a whiff and I have to take a step back? Î¾You might be S-T-I-N-K-Y. Î¾But who am I to judge? Î¾I took a big step back and waited my turn. Î¾Free is the motivation here. Î¾I finally get up there to the McDonald's cashier and present my coupon to the guy. Î¾He takes a look at it and says 'We don't usually take the promo coupons at this location but we'll let you use it."" Î¾Then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons! Î¾Mind boggling to say the least. Î¾He takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of McWrap I want (Grilled Chicken & Bacon) and rings me up. Î¾$2.91 later I'm given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called.I wait. Î¾And wait. Î¾#1! Î¾#2! Î¾#3! Î¾#5! Î¾#6! Î¾#7! Î¾#8! Î¾Obviously I'm #4 and 10 minutes later I am still waiting. Î¾Honestly, what the Hell are you guys doing back there? Î¾Mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla? Î¾Feathering a chicken? Î¾Perhaps ripening a tomato? Î¾I ask the McDonald's runner and he tells me, ""We're waiting for your McWrap."" Î¾Of course.At this point I'm almost running late to be back at work, so the minute I get my order I bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk. Î¾Thankfully I'm only three minutes away. Î¾I really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of Reese's chocolate peanut butter eggs from last Easter. Î¾Talk about disappointment! Î¾I take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk. Î¾I continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be McDonald's claim to fame. Î¾Their golden fries. Î¾I bite into one, eh a bit stale. Î¾I bit into another one, eh not enough salt. Î¾I bite into yet another one, eh cold?? Î¾I look down, and whaddaya know? Î¾My damn fry is not even barely cooked! Î¾White like Olivia Wilde in the winter. Î¾I look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly! Î¾Not golden brown! Î¾Not delicious! Î¾Barely out of their frozen state, and just limp. Î¾Not acceptable! Î¾Please check my pic for proof of this travesty. Î¾McDonald's not doing their fries right is like IKEA not serving their Swedish Meatballs with gravy. Î¾NO BUENO.After getting over this somewhat I finally hit my stride to go on to my Grilled Chicken & Bacon McWrap. Î¾Wow, talk about lightning striking twice. Î¾This thing was lifeless! Î¾After unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell something was off. Î¾Tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long. Î¾The chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either. Î¾After some hesitation, I took a bite. Î¾UGH I say, UGH! Î¾Freshness was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald's today. Î¾All cold and soggy! Î¾And upon all, my McWrap wasn't built correctly! Î¾Instead of having Spring Mix like it's supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce! Î¾And my bacon was missing! Î¾In the words of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO! Î¾It was McCrap through & through. Î¾Totally upset over this one. Î¾I have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well. Î¾McDonald's you have pissed off the wrong fatty. Î¾I will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure. Î¾Knowing my luck I'll get a coupon for a free McWrap.

"This McDonald's is located at the food side entrance of the Nellis at Craig Walmart Super Center. At the time that I stopped in Walmart on the way to Utah, I ate breakfast here.

"I never thought I would write a review of a McDonalds, much less have to write a negative review for a McDonald's. I don't even know how it's possible that a McDonald's could be so bad but unfortunately this one is. Î¾ Like many people, I have eaten at McDonalds all over America and even in several other countries. Î¾I have to say this is probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippines -and that's only because I'm not sure that what was in those burgers was even beef.Where do I begin? The service is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get cheese when I ask for none. I get onions when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwiches when I ask for 4 apple pies. Î¾I have given up on going through the drive thru because I always end up having to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes Î¾just to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actually have to tell them, ""No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered a McDouble.""The food is almost always cold. The burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line, I just don't understand how the fry's can be cold and stale. It absolutely defies logic. Yes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It's one of the reasons I keep going back. There's nothing like hot Fry's from McDonalds.. and also, just because it's McDonald's. Like it or not, it's a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product. I am sure they are turning a profit. No doubt. It seems to always be busy. However, I truly believe that if ANY other burger joint opened up right next door, this place would close down in a month. Every time I say I'm never going back, I still do. Unfortunately, tonight will be one of those nights as the kids specifically requested it.

Knowing how bad the drive through service has been I went inside and placed an order for a burger. The lobby wasn't trashed but in a need of a sweep and a wipe down.

The register guy did come out to sweep and while he did try his best I have to wonder why he choose to move the chairs at my table and sweep below my feet (remember that it was the only clean table in the store) and ignore what I'm only guessing was a hunk of apple on the floor at the table across from me or the fry and salt residue on the seats of the same table? He even went so far as to pick up a stack of napkins from the floor and put them onto the table top.

How complicated of an order can it be??!! Sometimes I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usually where they royally screw it up. I'm irritated just thinking about the visits Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visits they screwed something up. To make this brief, here are my major issues. I order Splenda to be added to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and carefully add it myself and spill on my clothes since they A) they always fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make any more stops!

I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really! I ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service!I did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him.

One was for ""McDonalds Pizza""This thing (the painting) was pretty badass though, that's why I took the pic. It's like 10' x 6'. I think it was dated 1979.

Then when my order was up and I asked for ketchup, she rolled her eyes and acted like I was making her go so far out of her way to reach under the counter.

"On Christ almighty here it goes. If I am going to eat overpriced McDonalds in a casino I better get what the hell I want to eat. This place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry. I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes:Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you.My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least. Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me. After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight Î¾cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor.

He ended up waiting over 30 minutes in line to get 2 egg Mcmuffins and coffee, and I had to wander out of the room to see what the hold up was.

"I went to this location a couple of weeks ago. This is how my visit went:I pulled in the drive thru a few minutes before 10:30am just in time for breakfast. I was the only person in the drive thru so I pulled right up to the menuI waited for someone to take my order at the speaker but no one said anythingFinally an employee with an headset walked out of the back room of McdonaldsI figured this was because the order speaker was broken or somethingBut no, the employee walked over and flipped the menu from breakfast to lunchtimeI was thinking in my head .... whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?Keep in mind, my car is right there, I'm obviously waiting to order.Then the employee turned around and walked back into McDonaldsThen someone started taking my order over the speakerI ordered my breakfast items. which they informed me they were no longer serving. I was thinking in my mind ""do you not think I just saw you walk out and turn the menu, I mean my car was like 2 feet away from you""Anyway, I was craving breakfast, so I let them know I wanted to cancel my orderI was told the breakfast hours were overThen ... magically ... like a Christmas Miracle, they had breakfast for me.Truth is I was willing to leave McDonalds with out my breakfast food. I have a rule for myself. I never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors. Yea, maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality. So I was completely polite about canceling my order. I do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items. Where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service. That conversation of them no longer serving breakfast was one we should have never had. Implying that my order was an inconvenience when clearly It shouldn't have been. So then, i went back a few days later (because I'm the type that gives second chances) and they missed a few items that I had ordered. Meaning I ordered them, saw it on the drive thru order menu screen, paid for it and it wasn't in my bag when they gave me my order.Yea, this is a long review, I would honestly be surprised if someone read down this far. Props to you if you have. But the whole reason behind it is that I am just super tired of getting terrible customer service and paying for food that I don't get.

"After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango. Î¾I just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack. Î¾Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy. Î¾Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done. The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge.

"This particular location has by far the worst service overall. I am not lying when I say that 7 out of 10 visits whether it be drive-thru or walk-in, something is wrong with my order. I can remember my order for extra onions on McRib sandwiches or hamburgers have been produced with extra pickles and no onions. A recent visit took 25 minutes to produce a 10 piece chicken mcnuggets and a soda. I've worked at a McDonald's before, and if I had a valid food card, and ambassadorial privileges, I could have changed the oil, re-heat the fryer, located a box in their freezer, and fry my own food, and still get to school on time. The shift manager gave me a large fries and 2 cups for drinks, not being sensitive to the fact that I had diabetes, and I had ordered nuggets for speedy service and avoidance of excess carbs.The service today was not as bad, but why do they go through the trouble of asking what kind of sauce do I want with my nuggets if they aren't going to give it to me? The guy at the window actually tried to shove me out of drive-thru with only a partial order.

"Every time that I go to the welcome screen on Yelp, I keep seeing ""Your next review awaits"" with a picture of Ronald McDonald patting a man I don't know. Yelp wants me to write the review and I am tired of seeing this when I go on the welcome screen. So, I will write a review on the McDonald's in Sam's Town. Î¾When I write a review I try to look at a unique aspect of the business. When it comes to fast food restaurants, it takes some thinking. What makes this McDonald's unique is that it features the exact Western motif displayed throughout Sam's Town. It is incorporated in a food court in back of the mountain where the robotic Mystic Falls robotic animals perform. I don't know of any McDonald's where I could grab a Big Mac and fries and watch a robotic cast of animals performing in a laser show, What also makes this McDonald;s unique for a location off the Strip is that they do not honor the $1 Any Size Beverage promotion. Î¾The Sam's Town McDonald's is one of a few food choices in Sam's Town. In my opinion I pass over their coffee and dessert for Dunkin Donuts. I pass over their lunch and dinner menu for the Firelight Buffet, Panda Express, and Subway. For my tastes, this McDonald's is advantageous for a light snack or a Large Coke for the drive home. The time I spend on the line justifies a check-in. It is the McDonald's of Sam's Town, and it gets busy. In comparison to a similar McDonald's in the D casino, the employees are friendly.

(Sidenote: Why do they do that in the first place? I mean, if that is what I wanted, I would have ordered it.) ""May I please have #12 with a Sprite."" ""Would you l like to add on an apple pie for $.50?"" ""Um, no."" ""$7.01, please pull up to the first window."" So I pay. Drive to window #2. Man opens the window hands me the drink and the bag of food. I asked for a S&S Sauce packet. The guy responded. ""We charge for that now."" ""Ha, that's hilarious. Just one please."" ""No really, they are $.28"" ""What? You're kidding right?"" ""No ma'am, if you want one you'll have to pull back around the drive thru.""

"McDonald's is McDonald's. Not much to say when you write a review about it, other than specifics. Here goes.The outside is decorated very nicely. There is a VERY spacious patio area with an HDTV you can watch games on. It is situated directly adjacent to a very large soccer field that is often used. Unfortunately, this means that at night, during games and practices, the parking lot is mostly full due to people parking there for their games.Do not let the parking lot fool you if there is a game in progress. It's probably not very packed at all.Another thing relates to the free wifi. They have the power outlets inside ONLY under a large HD tv where they have 4 comfortable chairs set up. This tells me they only want people using the internet over there and not at the tables, keeping the tables open. From a business perspective, this is smart. From a me being annoyed when I can't use my computer for a long time at a table perspective, this sucked.My air conditioner went out one day and I needed a place to work (I work from home). I went to this McDonald's and had so slump over my laptop all day under a TV blaring ESPN.Also, this place fills up right after the nearby high school lets out in the afternoon and stayed this way for a couple of hours until the parents picked most of the children up.

"This is the only McDonald's near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into DT Portland or go across the bridge. Tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but I just can't do it anymore. And here's why.One, look at the storefront photo. I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don't get why they can't read instructions properly or anything. Why can't the condiment be separate and not default? It's so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they ""got it right"" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said ""F it"" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.I didn't go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn't a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn't be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn't have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can't do their job. I don't even get much time to eat lunch so I didn't have time to go back and complain. I'm done with this location any way so if I'm craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I'll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn't crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries. The best place for that would be the Beaverton location near Uwajimaya off highway 10 (I think that's it.)Conclusion: If you crave McDonalds, don 't go to this location unless you want dead flies in Î¾your burgers/sandwiches or missing Chicken McNuggets.",near work probably everyone else unless drive south dt portland go across bridge try give place chance couple screw cant anymore whyone look storefront photo upload photo time review originally take early year mainly another bad experience need tell everyone come suckso first time photo show dead small black fly lettuce classic crispy chicken sandwich usually order without mayo get sandwich st time guess mayo dont get cant read instruction properly anything cant condiment separate default frustrate way nd time get sandwich get right except fly part already go car say f take picture proof rip contaminate area lettucei didnt go location awhile incident crave chicken mcnuggets since isnt fresh produce item whatever decide wouldnt big deal boy wrong think might happen twice count nugget miss piece meal shouldnt count many nugget sadly people cant job dont even get much time eat lunch didnt time go back complain im location way im crave sandwich chicken mcnuggets ill drive across bridge go probably isnt crap like location know serve ton people since location bad job fry bit overprice thing case think get decent deal large fry best place would beaverton location near uwajimaya highway think thats itconclusion crave go location unless want dead fly burgerssandwiches miss chicken mcnuggets,0,0.1783778965473175,0.15841512382030487,0.1534588783979416,0.20030488073825836,0.12457918375730515,0.04087819531559944,0.1439858078956604,1

"I stopped at this location with my boyfriend earlier this evening to grab a bite to eat after stopping off to pick up some things for his apartment and this was one of the most ghetto McD's I've been to.

"I do not normally go to McDonalds but I saw a line of cars in the drive through and thought this place must be excellent to have so many clamoring for their food. Upon entering this establishment I came upstairs n their varied many and perused the items hoping upon hope that they had Foie gras as I had a taste for the liver of a goose. It was not to be found. They must be animal rights activists that run this establishment. I asked the young girl at the counter what their speciality was and she told me the Big Mac was one of their finer dishes. I placed the order along with some French fries, I no longer call them freedom fries now that the French have come fully on board with our war against Muslim countries #jesuischarlie I wonder how these French fries will be served, I am imagining they will be garnished with black truffles . I ask for their wine list and am told they do not have one. How peculiar for a restaurant that serves French food. To my horror no baguettes either. My food bill comes to 6.30 cents. Imagine that, the Big Mac meal , their finest offering and it is only just over 6 dollars. The wait is not long for my entree, so glad I did not ask for their freedom onion soup. Strangely the food is in a box and a carton. This must be a new style , the creativity of chefs these days knows no bounds. I am impressed. I open up the box and there lies this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it. It is cold and damp. This must be an artistic statement of some kind. Possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the Intuit natives at the turn of the last century. I am impressed by the chefs social concerns but I had wished that the food was hot. I took a bite . I am glad that I sat close to the toilet as I made a run for it. They must have been upset that I ordered the foie gras originally. They are making me pay for it. I know when I have been defeated. My pomme frites were hot but lacking any French accoutrements. This must be French cooking under the Vichy government when the Germans took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausages. Completely defeated I made my way to the exit sign as I heard a cackle of teenage girls laughing at me as I tripped over the yellow wet floor alert signal.

Î¾Not just an item or two so she could make sure we were the next order, but she wanted to know everything we had ordered.

"Normally I don't bother reviewing places like this, but this McDonalds is so hilariously awful that I felt it was my duty to share this information with fellow Yelpers.The irony of this specific McDonalds is that it is an exceptionally nice one both inside and out. It is ultra-modern with a great little outdoor garden with seats! I've never seen a McDonalds like this before.Unfortunately it is absolute chaos inside. As some other reviewers have said, the staff have no control over it and it turns into a free-for-all.

I'm surprised no one has been stabbed and/or shot.Even if you are just passing by, you will immediately know something is up with this place.

Again, it's nothing short of a miracle that people haven't been stabbed or shot here.

"This is by far the worst McDonald's I have ever been too. Sure, when I was there it was busy, though it wasn't so busy you couldn't find a seat... Yet there was a mob of people waiting to get food, and they give you a # and you have to wait til your # comes up to get serviced. This is kind of fair, so the people who were there first get served first...... BUUUUUUT all I ordered was a plain old 49 cent ice cream cone because I needed to break a 10. And I think it took at least 20 minutes for me to get a SOFT SERVE ice cream cone. It would have taken someone 15 seconds to pull some ice cream out of the soft serve into a cone and then I would have been out of that mob. While I was in the mob waiting to be served, they called out a # for two ice cream cones OVER AND OVER again.

"Three cardinal sins:1) The ice cream cones cost twice as much here as other locations around Chicago. Granted, this means I'm paying $1.08 instead of $0.54. Some might say it's pointless to critique this - it's just fifty cents! But I say, NO! They're charging TWICE the price. Name another thing sold anywhere at a franchise where the price can vary so wildly. ALSO, I hate McDonald's, and the only reason I go there is because they're losing money by serving me under-priced ice cream cones - they can't possibly profit from this.

"Today was the breaking point. Long ago, McDonald's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining, a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time. These days, efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference, complacency, and a lack of disregard to customer priorities. On most mornings, I will stop into McDonald's to grab a yogurt parfait for $1.12 as my morning breakfast. I did it because it was a healthy breakfast, tasted good, and was amazingly cheap. Before today, one of the top ten things I associate with McDonald's is efficiency, and today I can throw that word out the window because McDonald's no longer merits it.Today I left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because I didn't have dinner and I was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work. I arrived at 8:44am and I know this because Foursquare told me so when I checked in! Something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not moving.Great, these things sometimes happen, which was why I was glad that I left my house early so that if I actually did have to wait in line it wouldn't matter and I'd still be able to get what I wanted when I wanted it. The minutes started flying by and the line still wasn't moving! What happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy? Well you can all forget about it because it's clear that no one in this McDonald's during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.I got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in. The clerk wouldn't make a new coffee for the customers and the customers weren't having any of it. Watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because I was trying to get an order in and get to work on time! Î¾Because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers I ended up stuck in line waiting, waiting, and waiting in what seemed to be forever!Having arrived at 8:44am, it was now 8:54am and I hadn't made an order! I yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat. I slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to Starbucks. At Starbucks I spent $5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $5 I could have easily spent at McDonald's in order to get what I wanted, but apparently McDonald's no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food. Long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant, this McDonald's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency. There are not enough words in all of the languages I speak to describe the disgust that I experienced today at this McDonald's. It was disgraceful and a thorough exercise in human futility and it was ten minutes of my life that I will never gain back.",today break point long ago revolutionize restaurant industry fast food din paragon possible human ingenuity apply streamline process deliver maximum production food people least amount time day efficiency long matter replace indifference complacency lack disregard customer priority morning stop grab yogurt parfait morning breakfast healthy breakfast taste good amazingly cheap today one top ten thing associate efficiency today throw word window long merit ittoday leave house early express purpose order food breakfast didnt dinner short sleep need giant coffee go food keep sane long day work arrive know foursquare tell check something amiss large crowd people line simply movinggreat thing sometimes happen glad leave house early actually wait line wouldnt matter id still able get want want minute start fly line still wasnt move happen proud tradition corporate efficiency deliver customer want want high degree professionalism courtesy well forget clear one morning shift give one iota care anyone wait linei get third person line two customer start argue cashier want cream side coffee mix clerk wouldnt make new coffee customer customer werent watch people argue clerk get blood boil try get order get work time inability clerk placate customer end stick line wait wait wait seem foreverhaving arrive hadnt make order yell frustration utter lack disregard staff much amusement patron either wait order wait order boat slam door leave walk block starbucks starbucks spend giant cup coffee food could easily spend order get want apparently long care earn money since busy argue customer make everyone wait order wait food long go good old day quick food restaurant long adhere sense time service degenerate ultimate display incompetency enough word language speak describe disgust experience today disgraceful thorough exercise human futility ten minute life never gain back,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

"For years I've come to this McDonalds, but as the managers came and went the service and atmosphere has gotten worse, and worse. Î¾I have stopped going here as of January 1,2011. I'll tell you why. I stopped in to get my usual order but had to make a call out of state to my mom real quick, she didn't answered so I left a message (just so you know I wasn't there having a long conversation - and I sat because I don't like talking on a phone as I'm in line) I ended the call then immediately started looking for an address to someplace I was headed to, this all took a few minutes - not ten, fifteen or longer - a couple minutes. But before I could stand up and head on over to the counter I was approached by I believe the manager who didn't start off by saying ""Welcome to McDonalds..."" I instead got, ""Have you ordered yet?"", ""You can only be here 30 minutes"", and went into some speech about ordering, customers and length of time to be there??? I was like WTH? I told them I AM a customer, and in fact Î¾was just there hours earlier for breakfast and before I could say that I AM going to order they tapped on the wall as if to say ""you gotta go"" and walked away after giving me the third degree and truly made me feel unwelcomed. This was a VERY unpleasant encounter with this manager. I have NEVER just sat in a McDonalds, or any venue and not ordered. I DO NOT LOITER and was quite offended that this person insinuated that. Î¾In fact, I always order and take it home except this day I did sit for a a minute ( and earlier at breakfast I ordered my usual grub and sat maybe 5-7 minutes and took the rest home) or two as I completed my call, but I just got there and it was like this person appeared out of nowhere and started grilling me?

"HA! I read the reviews and could not agree more with what's been said. It's still all very true, unfortunately, based on my personal observation. To top it all off, I walked into the place to get some food, and found my car gone--AFTER my purchase was made!! A gentleman in the parking lot was kind enough to offer me the address and phone number of the towing facility, for whom he worked... I DO NOT hold the towing company responsible for doing what they believe is their job. I do, however, hold this business responsible for hiring people without a sense of observation, intelligence, common sense, humility, and accountability. Don't waste your property, cash, time, nor curiosity to even look at this place, because it's filthy on the inside: the floors of overlooked dirt and grime, door handles with more grease than gears in a sewing machine, the food always arrives after your next birthday (it seems) to get when ""prepared,"" and I don't think anyone has looked up at me once to offer me a sense of being heard and understood. When the staff rings up your receipt, they do nothing but look on in fatigue at their own reflections, and observe a strange sense of love, from cold comforts in the scratched up, ""stained-less"" steel counter tops.To the CDC: save a life, and look twice--the dirt and trained monkeys might have escaped from the same lab and work somewhere inside. The only thing fresh in this place is what will be on the toilette paper the next day as a result of the oil that, I imagine, was obtained from an underworld market exchange fashioned by cheap costs and the flesh of missing persons. Of course, some may say that I inflate the truth; consequently, that's how you feel when you pay money for something at a place that cheats you out of more than simply the so-called ""food.""

"The good news -- they've just remodeled this place, and it it super modern/stylish, like going to Starbucks.

Î¾As another review said, it's probably because it does seem like chaos to stand in a line 2-3 deep, place your order, and then step aside in front of the people who ordered before you, so the person fulfilling the order can shuttle to the counter & back delivering your bag of food. Î¾This actually got you your food pretty quickly, even in peak times.So now the newest system is a single register to take orders, and an electronic system that shows order numbers that are ready on a TV screen. Î¾Sounds great, right? Î¾Not at this location. Î¾For some reason their fulfillment process is very very slow. Î¾It took 10 minutes the other day for my order to come up, and with the old system, it would be 2-3 minutes consistently, I think it was faster because there were four individual teams working on fulfilling orders, not a centralized mainly single-threaded process with the new system.This morning I walked in, saw the line in front of the register was 2 deep, and 20 people were waiting for their orders (20!). Î¾This isn't DeKalb where a busload of people just walked in.

"I've been living in this neighborhood since I was 4. Back in the day, the cheapest place to get a burger and fries was Maxwell's on 31st. In my family during that time, eating at Mcdonalds was luxury item. Why was it a luxury? Because my parents highly frowned upon processed and can foods. As a rebellious child growing up, eat at a Mcdonald's was luxury. The closest place without a car had to be in McKinley Park. Fast forward a few years and the McDonald's express opened. Despite it being fastfood, it poses as a treat to all the locals in the neighborhood; after playing sports at Mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite. This Mcdonald's is very small compared to other Mcdonalds, but they do serve most items. Since they marketed their $1 menu couple of years ago, the dollar menu has never changed. McChickens and Mcdoubles were always a $1. Now with the advertised $1 breakfast menus and any size drink, there are a lot of cheap options. My only grievance is that they don't have sweet tea and salads, but unsweetened tea is available. It doesn't feel right to goto any McDonalds for a salad... it just doesn't make sense to me.I come here a couple times a month for ice coffee, hot coffee and a sandwich or two. The location is convenient to grab a quick bite, pick up my dry cleaning, or pick up a few small items from Walgreens.

"If I were to die and go to hell, this McDonald's would certainly provide a worthy backdrop for a nightmare imagined.Let's begin the story of my worst dinner of my life at this sad little stop in a strip mall of no particular visual appeal under a bleak and cold Chicago evening. All things being fair, the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances I won't get into here.Upon stepping to the counter, I gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a McDonald's Express, which is a new concept to me all-together. I decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka ""The Value Meal"". My meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server. The food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlins cooking the food? I could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers. At this point I made a snap substitution request, no coke, coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother. My server obligated me in silence and I acknowledged her generosity. I took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights, but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and emptied the contents of the bag, fries and napkins, no ketchup. I tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption, but alas no, they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat. I fetched several ketchup packets from the server, kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my table.Spilling out the ketchup packets on the table, I noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets. No turning back now, I dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself. So, to sum up:Fries. They left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette. Perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer. The luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down. Maybe some beer would have helped the process.Cheeseburgers. Lifting the top bun of any burger, you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation. Though consumable, the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long, also lukewarm.Coffee. I have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room. It was watery, lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffee.Ketchup Packets. Looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchup.Customer Service.

"This is a McDonald's Express, so it sadly doesn't have the entire menu at all times. Î¾It reminds me that advertisements often include ""participation and availability may vary by location"" notices - this would be one of those cases. Î¾Fortunately, the smaller menu means fewer different things for their cooks to remember how to prepare or distract them from these key menu items.Over half of the times I've been in here, no matter how busy, I've had my food handed to me in less than 2 minutes from paying for it. Î¾That's Express, people!The only thing that drags this place down is the atmosphere. Î¾the counter is tiny and only holds two registers, so at any busy point in time, the line of people engulfs the only walking space and makes its way to the door, and sometimes extends OUT the door, though I've only seen that during dinner times as I've passed by on my way home from Unique or something.The soda machine has once or twice been low on syrup, yielding a nasty beverage - but it's outside the counter, so you can refill it with something else on your own. Î¾The tables for sitting are VERY close together, meaning it's difficult to eat your food in peace at this location without being bothered by someone's family issues or rampant children. Î¾It can get very loud here.But all in all, if you're stopping in for something to go, this is a great place for that. Î¾Just make sure to check that what you want is on their smaller menu, and take note that sometimes the sales regular McDonald's can have on menu items doesn't necessarily apply here. Î¾So pay attention, and then you can enjoy your McDonald's food.And you'll enjoy it better at home instead of sitting in cramped quarters with rambunctious broodlings.",express sadly doesnt entire menu time remind advertisement often include participation availability may vary location notice would one case fortunately small menu mean different thing cook remember prepare distract key menu itemsover half time ive matter busy ive food hand less minute pay thats express peoplethe thing drag place atmosphere counter tiny hold two register busy point time line people engulf walk space make way door sometimes extend door though ive see dinner time ive pass way home unique somethingthe soda machine twice low syrup yield nasty beverage outside counter refill something else table sit close together mean difficult eat food peace location without bother someone family issue rampant child get loud herebut youre stop something go great place make sure check want small menu take note sometimes sale regular menu item doesnt necessarily apply pay attention enjoy foodand youll enjoy well home instead sit cramp quarter rambunctious broodlings,0,0.4990714192390442,0.24286241829395294,0.015566907823085785,0.033549513667821884,0.14235717058181763,0.015451286919414997,0.05114125832915306,0

"So my first experience with this McDonald's was the day that I moved in. I had a couple friends helping me. This McDonald's is directly across the street from my apartment.So, after witnessing a guy smash his van (we later were told by the po-po that it was stolen) into the light pole right at the corner, then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down North Ave., away from the scene, we decided we were hungry. We thought ""why not go to McD's"". Seems logical. I mean, McD's is always the same no matter where you go, right? And it was certainly conveniently located. At least it appears conveniently located. Oh, its not. Attempting to cross North Ave. at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hands. This is a 4, 5, 6, oh hell, I don't even know how many corners there are here, intersection. And one of the lights is only green for one side of the street, but has no sign indicating that anywhere, so people either don't stop or just stand there. You feel like you are playing Frogger. Except not with a pixellated frog, but rather with your own skin and organs.If you make it into the building with your spinal cord still attached to your body, you will see they always have at least 15 people working here. Yet, there are never more than 2 registers open at once. And the only people working those registers are either a. ancient, non-english speaking women b. mentally handicapped. Hey, I appreciate their sense of social responsibility to hire the old and degenerate. I do not appreciate the game of charades I must play with the cashiers to get my order right.While you are waiting the 15 plus minutes it takes to get your food here, you may notice that this McDonalds is a bit different from the rest. Ricky Martin pictures, signed Selena CDs and gigantic Enrique Iglesias are the decor of choice here. Apparantly, this is the Latin Rock n' Roll McDonalds. Couple that with the fact that its the only McDonald's I have ever seen that has Jalepeno's as a condiment and the fact that they look at me as if I am lost every time I walk in there, I think its safe to say the clientele here is pretty set.Overall, the location, service and neighborhood sucks.

"Never thought I'd write a review about a McDonald's, but I feel compelled. Î¾This one was just re-built, replacing a perfectly servicable old one. Î¾Whatever, it's their money.My problem with the new one is that its parking lot configuration and ease of ingress/egress is even more stupid than the old one, if that's possible. Î¾You see, if you're coming from the east, entrance into the lot, either via entrances on North Avenue or Lowell (one way north), is no problem. Î¾If you're coming from the west on North Avenue (or from the south on Kostner), you literally cannot enter the parking lot. Î¾At all. I thought by turning left onto Kostner (a fairly main-drag kind of street), I could enter (as you could with the old one). Î¾Nope. Î¾No entrance any more on Kostner. Î¾And you cannot turn left from North Avenue to Lowell because there's a median (I think: either way, you're risking an accident or a ticket). Î¾There's an alley directly behind the lot, which is not only fenced off from Mickey D's, but 'one way' going out. Î¾So I drive AROUND THE BLOCK, past Lowell (the one-way street next to McDonald's), to Kildare, back to North Avenue, then enter. Î¾Jesus. Î¾The entrance has one of those divided-curb thingys, which was barely wide enough for my compact car. Î¾There are TWO drive-thru lanes from which to order food, but then they merge into one waiting line, so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone who's been waiting longer, or vice-versa, so why bother? Î¾The rest was standard McDonald's (WHY can't you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burrito?)....I got no sauce, no ketchup, no napkins, nuthin'.OK, then to get out and go back east on North Avenue, you must basically repeat the maze-bullshit from above, only in the reverse. Î¾You used to be able to exit onto Kostner, then turn left on North Avenue. Î¾Now you are forced to either go west on Grand or North Avenue or go to Lowell, north Î¾to Wabansia (past a high school) to Kildare to North Avenue. Î¾Got all that? Î¾Apparently the city thinks it's more desirable for us to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only (inexplicably) one-way alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking McDonald's. Î¾I felt like rat in a ghetto-maze, only with a soon-to-be-cold Egg McMuffin.So in a nutshell, if you live west of here, you can't get in. Î¾If you live east of here, you can't get out. Î¾And ya can't really go north, either. Î¾It's maddening. Î¾If you must go to THIS McDonald's, walk or take the bus, seriously. Î¾From my house (at the halfway point between the two), I will just go down to the one at Kedzie/North. Î¾I realize McDonald's and/or the city are trying to protect themselves from lawsuits from our shitty driving, and that badly designed intersection, but if it's that dangerous (which it is) then just DON'T BUILD IT THERE.

"Well it may be a brand new store but it still suffers from the same problem as most fast food stores . Bad help ! I went with my wife and she ordered by number , no problem .

Waited what seemed like forever and a tray was pushed our direction , I did not see an extra dressing and asked about it , a manager type told me it was .95 extra , I told him I asked for it when I ordered , he looked at the receipt and said I was not charged for it and I would have to pay . It was not the .95 but how he said it .He was very condescending for such a young man . We go to Wendys on Roosevelt in Lombard and are treated like kings !

"I had the extremely rare and exciting experience of FINALLY getting a table at this dynamic and world renowned restaurant, at 7:00 AM, no less! Let me be the first to say that this place has THEE best hash browns of all time, ANYWHERE. Also, if you love lukewarm breakfast burritos, look no further. This place has it all: people ashamed of their weight, transients, less than average intelligent staff, and wet floor signs lining every footpath. I would highly recommend this restaurant to those with almost no money and a hankering for some good ol' fashioned microwaved meat, eggs, bread, and cheese. The biggest bonus for eating here, in my opinion, was the terribly unfriendly service and awkward negligence from the point of sale clerk that was very bothered by the simple request I made to have her hand my sausage burrito to the kitchen personnel for it to be microwaved to a safe temperature. I will have to, however, give this AMAZING place a one star rating because I was listening to my headphones when I first walked in and that song came on my pandora that I've never been too fond of.

"I had the extremely rare and exciting experience of FINALLY getting a table at this dynamic and world renowned restaurant, at 7:00 AM, no less! Let me be the first to say that this place has THEE best hash browns of all time, ANYWHERE. Also, if you love lukewarm breakfast burritos, look no further. This place has it all: people ashamed of their weight, transients, less than average intelligent staff, and wet floor signs lining every footpath. I would highly recommend this restaurant to those with almost no money and a hankering for some good ol' fashioned microwaved meat, eggs, bread, and cheese. The biggest bonus for eating here, in my opinion, was the terribly unfriendly service and awkward negligence from the point of sale clerk that was very bothered by the simple request I made to have her hand my sausage burrito to the kitchen personnel for it to be microwaved to a safe temperature. I will have to, however, give this AMAZING place a one star rating because I was listening to my headphones when I first walked in and that song came on my pandora that I've never been too fond of.

Nothing was good - right from the phony looking decorations and fake plants to the managers attitude!Before ordering - I asked if I could get a milkshake because it was early and was told yes - I proceeded to order my meal along with three other colleagues. The order was messed up as soon as the person taking the order realized she couldn't get me my milkshakes, which meant she had over charged our credit card. She had no idea what to do about that and had to get the manager who then acted like it was my fault and refunded the cash for one milkshake. However, there were two ordered and two charged so she had to then refund more cash - these milkshakes costs over three additional bucks over the normal price of the meal we ordered that included drinks - I know confusing. So after refunding the cash - I asked what I could get to drink and she said that would cost more - there was no drinks that would come with my meal???? So I just got a freaking glass of ice water!The place was not clean - the service was P@## Poor and I would NEVER return to this location.

"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SHAMROCK SHAKE ONLYIt's brighter green than I remember. An extremely unnatural shade of green that doesn't occur normally in nature. For as unnatural the color is, the flavor is just as fake. I don't think there is any actual mint or dairy in these things. I think they are petroluem-based.Does it taste different than it used to? Definitely. A few years ago, McD's did the unthinkable. They ditched their old shake recipes for a new faster/cheaper/easier shake ""system"". Basically, a neutral vanilla shake comes out and different flavored syrups are mixed in at the last minute. The result is a sub-par product. Syrupy and too sweet. It's not even mixed when it comes out. It's like those thousand-flavor ice cream joints that do the flavor syrups. YUKIs the Shamrock Shake disgusting? YESDo I kind of love it?

"This review screams ""First World Problems""...but until Yelp opens up a site that allows us to review establishments in the ""Third World"" (can one even still use that term without being offensive?), I guess all of the things about which we gripe will be ""First World Problems,"" won't they?Anyhow, my wife was hungry one evening so we stopped here to grab a bite to eat through the drive-thru. We actually enjoy eating at McDonald's in general and think the food is good (some people will probably find that statement more offensive than the above comments about terminology!), so it's not like this was a bad option. We actually used to stop at this one pretty often on our way home from church when we lived on the East Side and we generally received great service.Unfortunately, tonight was a night on which we received awful service.When we pulled up to the drive-through, the McDonald's employee let loose with this rapid-fire barrage that was presumably supposed to tell us what food wasn't available. I'm a teacher, and I'm used to deciphering...but this was incomprehensible. Of course, when we mistakingly ordered something that was deemed off-limits, we were made to feel like buffoons.After we finally managed to figured out what was available, we ordered and pulled up to the window. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out what happened next--that's right, they got the order partially wrong. One of my wife's Chicken McNuggets even wound up outside of the container. Perhaps it was in a hurry to escape an environment completely void of any sort of concern for the customer, or perhaps they couldn't be bothered to take an extra second to close the container fully. I'll let you be the judge on that one. They also gave her the wrong sauce. I had no idea that ""Sweet and Sour"" actually means ""Barbeque.""Why we stopped at this McDonald's instead of driving to the McDonald's on Clark--which consistently provides amazing customer service that surely makes Ray Kroc smile in his grave--is beyond me.

"Taking the ""fast"" out of fast food...THE UP-SIDE: Î¾Once in a while, we all eat at McDonalds. Î¾This one happens to be very clean and nearly ""nice"" on the inside. Î¾However...THE DOWN-SIDE: Î¾I've gone to this location several times over the past two years. Î¾Each time, I went through the drive-through and had to endure a wait of over 10 minutes. Î¾I literally waited 15 minutes in line on two different ocassions. Î¾So, just today when I visited, I thought, ""Hmm. Î¾I'll be smart this time. Î¾I'll go inside to beat the line drive-through line wrapping around the building."" Î¾Well, I should have known better. Î¾Inside, the line snaked to the door; just two feet from where I entered the restaurant. Î¾They had one woman on the register and she was moving at a snail's pace.I waited for a full 10 minutes - yes, I'm an idiot - and still hadn't even gotten to place my order.

Î¾Frustrated and hating myself for giving this place yet another shot, I left without food and vowed NEVER TO RETURN.THE SUM-IT-UP: I really don't like McDonalds that much, but I do think that they seem pretty well-run overall.

"This review is based on the poor service I received in the drive thru last night. I have nothing to say about the food because it's McDonald's... I had a horrible headache and a long drive back from The Woodlands so I just decided to swing through the drive thru to grab some food hoping it would help my headache. There were two cars in front of me when I pulled into the line. One car was at the pick up window, the other was at the intercom to order. It didn't take long for the car in front of me to order. When it was my turn, I literally sat there for 3 minutes without anyone acknowledging me. Usually if the employees are slow, they will at least say hello and then ask for a moment to help other customers. I was about to yell into the intercom to make sure they were in fact open. People were pulling up behind me and I was losing my patience. Finally some lady came on the intercom and said ""What can I get you?"" As if they were the ones waiting on me to decide. I could hear a lot of noise in the background (sounded chaotic). I asked for a grilled chicken wrap. She responded with ""We don't have grilled meat, wait yeah ok grilled what else?"" Then I asked for Sprite. ""We're out of Sprite."" Ok please give me unsweet ice tea. ""OK Sweet tea."" At that point, my headache was so bad I didn't even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea. Then she told me to drive forward without telling me a total. As I'm waiting to pay and get my food, I see at least two cars leave the drive thru line because they're fed up with the poor service. When I got to the window, the lady even made a comment about it ""Ooooh look at all those cars leaving."" I'm sorry, but if you are aware that you are losing customers, maybe you should step it up a little bit and get your shit together so you don't lose customers. She couldn't have cared less. It was pathetic.Luckily I don't live in that area, so I'm hoping to never have to experience such slow, horrible service in a drive thru.

"I have developed a new rule for cheat meals/meals where I am eating my feelings/and other ""should not be eating this"" meals associated with professional/personal stressors: if the first thing out of your mouth is ""we are out of Diet Dr Pepper"" then I am going to keep driving. This being an experience of course that began with: ""oh man, couldn't get across the lanes on 59 to get to the usuals"" and had to take a later exit.I am not a total hater on McDonalds, their bacon mcgriddle is perfect for curing the Jose Cuervo, Dos Equis, and Malbec back-alley, no holds barred brawl raging in your stomach - the devil and god raging inside of you that Philosopher Jesse Lacey oft muses upon. The bacon mcgriddle becomes even better if you eat it at an airport or in the middle of a loong roadtrip, it is something like the manifest destineers enjoying their cured and salted meats many miles from home, a mile from typhoid on the Oregon Trail video game, and still a long ways away from the Willamette Valley.In this instance, I was running late and did not have time for my usuals of kolaches and/or bagels and/or breakfast tacos, sadface. Sadface indeed as I was stripped of my Diet Dr Pepper this morning at gunpoint and forced to go with something more disappointing than finding out you are the father on the Maury Povich show: having to drink Diet Coke with your bacon mcgriddle.Sometimes the mcgriddle comes out greasy, that is to be expected. But this time the bag was see through and shiny, the grease from the hash browns meshing with the mcgriddle's so much it is impossible to tell where one riptide of grease began and where the other ended. Disgusting with a bunch of exclamation marks like this!!! And this!!!! For good measure, this too!!!! On top of that the mcgriddle bun bottom was scorched, even with a black scorch mark, I am not being hypercritical about that. The cheese was too much and stuck to the wax paper.

"Normally I wouldn't review a fast food joint, but our (meaning my husband's and my) collective negative experiences have prompted me to review it.Every time we go there (usually through the drive-thru), they always forget something or get something wrong!!

Whether it's french fries, ketchup, dipping sauce, straws or even an extra patty (we like to order the double Filet-O'-Fish).You might be thinking, ""Well, it's McDonald's what do you expect?"" And you're right. We should know better, and we should always check the bag before leaving. But I digress. My one and only example of the Idiocracy-type service I've experienced I will give is this: I went through the drive-thru and ordered two meals with large drinks each. When I got to the food window, I was given one large drink and one medium. When I complained and said it wasn't what I ordered, the guy at the window looked bewildered. He said he couldn't fix it because the automatic drink machine wouldn't allow him to manually pour another one. Then when I asked, ""Well, can't you just go get me another one?"" he said, ""I can't leave my spot."" Then I countered with, ""Well, can you get someone ELSE to do it?"" he said, ""Uh, I can't leave my spot. I can give you a cup and you can come inside to get it yourself."" What?? I went through the drive-thru because I had just come from the vet and I had the dog in the car. I told the employee, ""I went through the drive-thru because I have my dog with me!"" He didn't say anything. I mean, he obviously wasn't the best with troubleshooting OR customer service, so, I went to park, got the drink and left.

"This is the McDonald's that my friends and I always go to since it's the closest to our apartment but at the same time, it's definitely the WORST one I've ever been to.One plus is that their drive-thru is open 24 hours but sadly, the later at night you go, the more often your choices are limited. For example, one day we were craving their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machine was off already so they couldn't make it! Okay. What's the point of staying open 24 hours if you can't even give the customers the food they want?!The other day, I had a pretty bad dine-in experience. The lady behind the counter charged extra for big mac sauce on the McDouble which I have NEVER experienced before. Usually going through drive-thru, they never charge extra for a McDouble w/o the ketchup, w/ big mac sauce and shredded lettuce (a.k.a a Big Mac, but cheaper!). My boyfriend and I were pretty shocked when she told us we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really NEVER DO!!Then, this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change! She told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she opens it for the next customer.

"Is it possible to put no stars in this branch?I mean this place is probably in the top ten list of the worst McDonalds franchises in history.They ALWAYS screw up our order!

No bonuses, no here's something to make up for our crappy service, nothing like that!They will not give you ketchup or napkins unless you ask for it so if you forgot, you'll be eating your fries as is!If you order a combo, they would ask you ""...medium or large?""

"(I wrote most of this on the toilet!)Did you like the movie ""Falling Down""? Then this is your McDonalds, friend!

We rarely visit the place and let's be honest, we all know what to expect. Yeah, it's terrible for you. It's a chain with no ""indie cred"", but it's hard to deny that a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit is delicious even if it's not served by a cool guy with a handlebar mustache.So I rolled up to the San Fernando location, just blocks away from the infamous Drew Street and former Avenues Gang stronghold. The drive through line was looooong and I thought, ""I'll just go in!"" That'll be quick, right?The interior was that edge-of-anarchy you only get on a Saturday in a sketchy corner of a big city. Kids, post-soccer games all jacked up on Cokes and orange slices, a dense crowd that stands a liiiiitle to close, a few vagrants and an overwhelmed staff that handles it fairly well.I finally left about 15 minutes later (yes, really), after several false alarms of ""Oh! I think that's mine."" Î¾Ironically, my ORANGE JUICE is what held up the order while I watched the biscuit, McMuffin and hashy-b's get cold. Î¾I walked out politely but my head was spinning with entitled yuppie frustration and thoughts of ""Well, I'm never going in there again."" One time, no joke, I got a cheeseburger with no burger! Kinda hilarious actually, and the manager came through for me with a TWO free cheeseburgers as an apology. Despite all that, YOU KNOW I'LL STILL BE BACK.

"This is my third review of McDonald's across three different cities. Î¾Yelp, I hope you're paying attention, because if this veritable display of fast food prowess isn't enough to grant me Elite status, I just don't know what is.Because it's McDonald's, and everyone knows that McDonald's serves the most amazing flash-frozen food in the world, I employ a different rating system where every one I go to starts at 5 stars. Î¾I take off stars according to my experiences there.Let's begin for this location:5 stars: it's McDonald's, for chrissake. Î¾I don't need to justify this.4 stars: I had to knock it down one star because they ran out of cheeseburgers once at like 2:00am. Î¾When they first told me, it didn't even register in my brain. Î¾I ordered two cheeseburgers and the lady replied ""sorry, we don't have cheeseburgers right now."" Î¾All I could say was ""no, just a regular one, not a McDouble."" Î¾She had to repeat it again and I was so flabbergasted that I sat silently in the drive-thru window as my world was crashing around me. Î¾Four hours later I was able to collect my thoughts and order a Filet-O-Fish.3 stars: there is a constant ring of transients that surround this place late at night. Î¾They come up to you when you're pulling up to the window. Î¾They don't even ask for food, they try and give you money to buy stuff for them because, presumably you can't ride a shopping cart into the drive-thru. Î¾One time I was feeling nice and bought a lady a coffee, but then she proceeded to yell at me as I was driving away because I only got her 10 sugar packets instead of the 50 million that she requested. Î¾On the plus side, the establishment does a reasonably good job of keeping them out after hours, so now I know where to board myself up during a Zombie Apocalypse.2 stars: one time they questioned me when I ordered 80 nuggets. Î¾DID I STUTTER? Î¾It's 3:00am on a Saturday night, you should be questioning the people who get a 6 piece. Î¾100 is pretty standard these days. Î¾With two of every sauce, including some that don't exist (""zesty...chipotle...thai peanut butter?"")

"Not to madly contradict what others are saying, but in fairness the location is in an industrial part of downtown L.A. in the Produce Market area. At night, the area is pretty desolate until the early morning hours of around 3 or 4 in the morning when the area comes alive. Now I will admit that the proximity to the Greyhound station isn't attracting the typical McDonalds crowd, and I expect they sell more Dollar Menu items than they do Happy Meals. And it wouldn't be my first choice ordinarily, but the other McDonalds at Olympic and Central was closed due to remodeling on a night I was really craving some fries on the way home. So I put on my bold face (the one that says ""don't ask me S**T!"") and figured I'd tough it out at Alameda and 7th. It was around 9:00pm on a weeknight.When I pulled in, I noticed how brightly lit it was. And while there seemed to be a few cars in the drive thru, none of them looked like they were waiting for very long. Seeing the same type of buzz inside, I decided to go inside and walk up to the counter.When I got inside, I can only guess someone there reads Yelp reviews. It was ridiculously clean, they seemed to have adequate staff on hand, and they moved very efficiently. The counter staff was very friendly, the food came fast and was hot.Now naturally this shouldn't be a guarantee for all future visits... but it was a good experience and shows what can be done. As such, my star ratings reflect the service and the cleanliness. Because it's been there so long, I won't ding them for the location or the neighborhood.",madly contradict others say fairness location industrial part downtown la produce market area night area pretty desolate early morning hour around morning area come alive admit proximity greyhound station isnt attract typical crowd expect sell dollar menu item happy meal wouldnt first choice ordinarily olympic central close due remodel night really crave fry way home put bold face one say dont ask st figure id tough alameda th around pm weeknightwhen pull notice brightly light seem car drive thru none look like wait long see type buzz inside decide go inside walk counterwhen get inside guess someone read yelp review ridiculously clean seem adequate staff hand move efficiently counter staff friendly food come fast hotnow naturally shouldnt guarantee future visit good experience show star rat reflect service cleanliness long wont ding location neighborhood,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

"LOL Why am I reviewing a McDonald's? WHY, WHYYYY you ask!Let me tell you, I don't like McDonald's, in fact I have grown to dislike it so much that I don't even like the chicken nuggets--yup, I went there. But on a day, when I felt like eating at the McDonald's, I decided I would eat there...because you gotta try a McDonald's if there's Î¾a McDonald's, right? I always do that with every semi-permanent place I visit.What I found on my first visit, and subsequent visits was a newfound appreciation for McDonald's. I mean, like I felt like a kid again--you know, back when I liked it. This McDonald's made me like McDonald's, but ONLY this McDonald's! The workers are really nice and friendly, and this McDonald's apparently sets the record for workers who do not speak English. The bathroom is clean, and I'm glad they make you pay for it--always a winner in my book! I don't know what it is, but the food actually tastes good...like food! You don't feel like you're eating crap or trash, it's amazing! It's good McDonald's, the way it was when you were a five year-old. I can't believe it. I can't explain it. I will dream of eating here again.They have a security guard, which impressed me. And since they are a 24-hour, I won't lie to you...I've considered it...and it's quite the drive! hahaNow the reviews for this location seem terrible. Hobo-central?

With a roller backpack full of ideas anxiously waiting to get off the train at Union Station after the long trip from headquarters in Oak Brook, IL. Pockets filled with employee schedules and a neatly folded franchise license. Then it got lost. Lost into the heart of a dismaying darkness along a transient corridor known as Alameda. Its employee of the month dreams fading against the howling winds of reality in LA, but with its golden arches still standing as a beacon for those hungry.Staff:I didn't think McDonald's could possibly produce employees this professionally hardened. No. The staff here have to be contractors. Hired guns. Soldiers of Fortune. Blackwater mercenaries. Î¾Warriors jaded after years of serving tours in suburbia and south central.

I went and asked why it was so small and the guy got a manager who told me the chicken is weighed and it was fine. I have never had a snack wrap like that before or since.

"So McDonald's is currently promoting a $14.99 for 2 big mac meals plus a 20 piece nuggets. Sounds like a great deal, so I stepped in to purchase said meal for my family of young and old.This place is always crowded (of all people other than customers) who use this place as a porta potty. Not a problem, since I would never sit down and eat here anyway. However, the customer service is pretty darn poor, and my 1 star is based solely on that (I have no expectations for McDonald's foods).They do not have enough staff. There was exactly one person working in the 'kitchen' (making burgers), one person working soda/fries/ice creams (who I assumed to be the manager) and one person working the cashier. Now I understand that they're working minimum wage, but that does not excuse them to work so poorly. I had to repeat my order four times, and it took 30 minutes to be completed. Why? Because the cashier was VERY distracted from conversing with friends and coworkers. I would give zero stars, but 1 star is for the manager, who seemed to be the only one who was trying to fulfill the customers orders.I haven't been to a McDonalds in years, and this experience will serve as a reminder to me of why I should continue not to do so.",currently promote big meal plus piece nugget sound like great deal step purchase say meal family young oldthis place always crowd people customer use place porta potty problem since would never sit eat anyway however customer service pretty darn poor star base solely expectation foodsthey enough staff exactly one person work kitchen make burger one person work sodafriesice cream assume manager one person work cashier understand theyre work minimum wage excuse work poorly repeat order four time take minute complete cashier distract converse friend coworkers would give zero star star manager seem one try fulfill customer ordersi havent year experience serve reminder continue,0,0.20256109535694122,0.17775261402130127,0.03567323088645935,0.06896039843559265,0.36348122358322144,0.006915421690791845,0.14465592801570892,0

"Located on the border of the West and Greenwich village, this McDonald's restaurant (which according to wikipedia is a part of the world's largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants) is in a prime location.While the decor is a little dated, it reflects the some of the architecture and older buildings in the village. Î¾There is also a great hanging mural of basketball players located above the register and can be better viewed while dining on the second floor of the establishment (the art most likely drew inspiration from the West 4th street courts located across from the restaurant, paying homage to the locals).Instead of order from a waiter you order individually through the designated cash registers, while this may seem like more work it does save you some extra cash and also lets you customize your order directly without having to go through another person. Î¾The menu itself has it's staples, 'The Big Mac' , 'Filet-O-Fish', 'McNuggets' and of course the french fries which are all bargains for the amount of food you receive when compared to other restaurants. Î¾There is also an ever changing rotation of new sandwich, wraps, salads and other specialty items; all of which have the same McDonald's quality.This past visit I ordered a McDouble, a large french fires and a 4 piece McNuggets. Î¾The food was ready for me in under five minutes, a time almost unheard of at other restaurants. I took a seat at the upstairs section and started with the McDouble. The McDouble included two cooked beef patties, cheese, pickles, ketchup and chopped onions, very satisfying for under 2 dollars. Î¾I then switched between the hot crispy french fries and the McNuggets (small deep fried pieces of chicken) which I dipped in ketchup and their very tasty honey mustard sauce. Î¾All in all I was very full and content with my meal, all of which cost me under $10, at any other local restaurant just a burger and fries would have run me more than $10 and most likely closer to $15.Although the food may not be on par, quality wise with other nearby eateries (Minetta Tavern, 100 Acres and Market Table), essentially you are getting a full meal at nearly half the price and a quarter of the time.

"Allow me to preface this review by saying that I have never actually purchased anything from this McDonalds. Maybe someday I will, because I work nearby in the Lipstick Building, but not yet.To tell the truth, there really isn't any reason to buy food from this McDonalds. East Midtown is like ground zero for bomb-ass gyro guys, including the excellent one on the southeast corner of 54th and 3rd, and the inimitable Rafiqi on 50th (or so) and 3rd. Any of these carts will be cheaper than McDonalds, since you're definitely going to pay Manhattan prices at this location. The dollar menu is certainly anemic. There is also an assortment of good sandwich and pizza places around here.So why am I reviewing this McDonalds, you might ask. It is simple. 3rd avenue faces a lack of good places to sit and eat, especially on a hot day and if you are wearing clothes that you don't want to risk getting gyro sauce on. If you need somewhere to sit and eat, regardless of where you purchased your food, this McDonald's is the place to go. They have excellent air conditioning, a supply of good napkins, clean tables, and a nice view of the street. I can attest to the fact that the staff WILL NOT roust you from your seat, even if you are blatantly not eating McDonalds. I have eaten gyros/sandwiches/pizza in this location several times and it has been an excellent place to eat on each occasion.",allow preface review say never actually purchase anything maybe someday work nearby lipstick build yetto tell truth really isnt reason buy food east midtown like grind zero bombass gyro guy include excellent one southeast corner th rd inimitable rafiqi th rd cart cheap since youre definitely go pay manhattan price location dollar menu certainly anemic also assortment good sandwich pizza place around hereso review might ask simple rd avenue face lack good place sit eat especially hot day wear clothe dont want risk get gyro sauce need somewhere sit eat regardless purchase food place go excellent air condition supply good napkin clean table nice view street attest fact staff roust seat even blatantly eat eat gyrossandwichespizza location several time excellent place eat occasion,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

"It's almost a year since the first reviewer wrote how rude the staff at this McDonalds is. I regret to say that nothing has changed. In fact, it's gotten worse. As someone on Foursquare commented, be prepared to wait on line for a LONG time. I waited for 10 minutes and the line never moved. I've never had such slow service at any McDonalds, and I've never had such slow service in Manhattan. I never thought I'd face this AT a McDonalds IN Manhattan. When a new line opened up, the server deliberately ignored me and called out in Spanish to a man who had been waiting in another line less than one minute, avoiding eye contact with me the whole time. I got on line behind him. She chit-chatted with him and then went and got his food herself instead of letting the staff in the back do it. Another 5 minutes. By the time I got to the front of the line, no ""welcome"", not even a smile for me. I ordered my breakfast. She took my money and then proceeded to take the next two orders--this time, of course, having the staff (which themselves were working at a snail's pace) get my food. She handed me the bag with no receipt and no ""thank you"". I thought to complain to the manager, and then I looked at the nameplate of the person serving me. She WAS the manager.

From now on, I'm getting my Big Mac fix at Penn Station or any of the other locations OTHER than this disaster at 28th and 6th.

"It feels silly to write a review for a fast food establishment but I'm writing this only to jog my memory of what happened earlier this week. I walked in with the intention of grabbing a quick post-beer snack with a buddy. We sat down with something like 20 chicken nuggets (gross I know) and started eating away. Some few minutes later, we hear a commotion towards the entrance. I turn around and see what appears to be the dirtiest looking homeless man with long grey hair and beard and dirt stained jacket with holes in his shoes. The manager happened to notice him immediately and tried to escort him out. One thing led to another and this guy started going off on one of the most hate-fueled rants I've ever heard. Surprisingly, he was quite eloquent and made references to movies, pop culture, and some literary classics. Objectively speaking, I imagined this 6'4ish looking man was at one point quite educated and maybe even handsome. I was too busy observing the scene to actually record anything for Youtube. At first, he directed his hatred towards the manager and then went into a long address to everyone in the store. Long story short: there is a revolution coming and we are ill-prepared. We are leading our lives in ignorance and before we know it, the tides will shift. Men ""like him"" are congregating and amassing technology and weapons beyond our knowledge. Lol ok. At this point, he gestured pulling out a weapon and shooting everyone. At this point, the manager forcibly escorted him out against his restraint. A few moments later, he ran back in and pulled out an imaginary grenade, tossed it in the store, and ran back outside. I was just trying to enjoy my chicken nuggets.

"I've eaten at Nougatine and ABC Kitchen numerous times, but I have to admit that I keep coming back to this fine institution for a great meal that puts JGV's work to shame. Î¾The french fries are an example of potatoes that have been prepared in a form that may be legitimately considered a work of art. Î¾The gentle texture and crisp of the fries are testament to the corporation's impeccable execution of deep frying, and the training that the personnel have undergone to achieve this perfection across the franchise is very much laudable. Î¾My experience with the beef has been nothing short of flawless. Î¾As I had requested, the patty in my burger was prepared to a medium-rare, and the subtle cheese and softly-grated onions danced with the rich ketchup and mustard on my tongue, as I tasted thick and quality processed meat between two pieces of toasted and warm buns. Î¾The acidity of the salted fries and that of the burger did not balance quite as I liked it, though I was very much satisfied anyway. Î¾I have to say that short of make-up sex, I have had no better experience in my 20's. Î¾To finish my three-course, the apple pies were magnificent. Î¾The texture of the apples led me to believe that they were, in fact, potatoes, but I must commend McDonald's for aptly managing their resources and overhead by taking advantage of economies of scale in purchasing only mass quantities of one ingredient, as opposed to diversifying their portfolio; this may lead to higher margins in that the franchises would be able to provide more products in their menu e.g. genuine apple smoothies or apple-infused panacotta, but would ultimately lead to higher operating costs. Î¾In any case, the dessert was very much satisfying.Though I paid only $6.00 for this meal, I must have gained the delight of a $60.00 meal.

Î¾This is causing more congestion as the one right lane blocks people who have ordered in the left lane from being able to advance and join the main paying lane (which forces both lanes to immediately merge), especially if the ones in the right lane tailgate and won't let you in, even though you placed your order before them, which would imply your order would come up first. Î¾You can easily sit in that left lane for 10 minutes while the people behind you are helpless and honk uselessly trying to move up to place their order.

"A McDonalds's with the worst continuing costumer service I have ever experienced on multiple occasions over the course of three years. Let's just say an average wait for a small fry is 25 minutes.Last night at 3:30 AM I pulled up to the drive-thru, just as a car was reversing out. I should have known then that I was warned. I continued to pull through, but after ten minutes or so no one asked me for my order. So I continued on through the drive thru, thinking I could order at the next window. Well actually I sat trapped in the drive thru for over thirty minutes with the line not moving, and my car not able to escape the raised drive thru. At one point an older male employee came to the first window, stood there, looked at me and laughed. Then he turned around and left (I assume to continue not doing work.)After a waste of 30 minutes, the car behind me left and I was able to reverse my way out. So I have a few recommendations: 1. Since your McDonalds sucks so much please do not barricade drive thru attendees without an escape route. 2. Learn how to make 'fast' food and 3. Fire your entirely incompetent staff.

"Firstly, let me address the previous reviews regarding the acceptance of credit cards only at certain times. If this happens to you, please call McDonald's and make them aware of this immediately. Your hard earned cash is being taken by questionable employees in the Grave-Yard Shift.

Î¾I have no clue what I did to piss this employee off but my friend who came with me, asked me what the heck happened. Î¾I said ""I have no clue, I'm just missing my fries..."" Î¾My friend was nice and *itchy enough to go up to the counter, grab the attention of a different employee and told him we were missing our fries.But honestly, what is wrong with you?

"Two points right out of the gate: 1. Thuggery knows no race (lily white frat boys from the suburbs can be just as vulgar and aggressive as any group with a gang mentality) 2. Rating a McDonald's and McDonald's food isn't really an essential service; people generally know what they're getting - menu and quality wise - going in. The purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor. People need to know (and I think locals already do) that, depending on the time of day (night), this place is marginally dangerous. Over my last three visits to Chicago, I've noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mobs who do more looting, aggressive panhandling, and fighting than choreographed performing. In fact, this particular McDonald's had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order. The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away has seen an increase in gang activity lately, including the arrest of some armed teenagers. This isn't just my take (check out some of the other reviews of this place and this neighborhood). Many are pointing out that the Mag Mile is slowly becoming the ""Mug Mile."" And this McDonald's seems to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation as they pour off the Red Line after taking up two seats on the subway while grandma has to stand. Apologists and the agenda driven will say (and have said): ""These kids are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood."" Really? Since when does being authentically ""black"" include screaming nonstop obscenities with little kids around (black and white)? Since when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime? Since when did it become open season on civility? [Since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionary/fascist?] While it's mildly funny that Katelyn, Emily, Ashley, and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the American Girl Doll store, nobody (not even the over-privileged, country club set) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior. And youth thugs (of any race) should NOT be permitted to turn this area into the ""Wild mid-West.""
